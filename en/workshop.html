      <h1>Workshop</h1>
      <pre style="margin-left: -35px;">
The training activities of our laboratory
  are  based on a scientific platform of creativity,
    which is not  alternative to the classical school of art history,
       but is complemented with it in the prospect of complexity.
         The workshop project has derived from the following presuppositions:

              <strong>a )</strong> recent scientific research is starting to reveal the mysterious
                creative process of art, so far considered unfathomable;

                  <strong>b )</strong> nowadays we know that sensations, intuition and the so called “artist’s sniff”
                    are not simple mental glimmers, but deep biopsychic impulses,
                      from which structured expressive acts emerge;

                        <strong>c )</strong> the artists, though, are still unable to value these natural resources of theirs,
                           because they can’t detect the biopsychic mechanisms,
                              which  automatically guide their expressive systems;

                              <strong>d )</strong> it is crucial to know these deep mechanisms of the visual language,
                                 because they trigger the interactions between the art work and the spectators;

                                  <strong>e )</strong> these interactions are mainly expressed through the "energetic resonance"
                                     between the art work and the global physicality of the spectators
                                       (sensorial and emotional intermodality, innate motivational systems, psycomotility,
                                          subsymbolic mechanisms, connective patterns, automatic elaboration,
                                            biological impulses of the aesthetic taste broken symmetry, synaptic weights,
                                              hidden units,sigmoid)..

                                        The workshops are addressed to the professionals of the following sectors:
                                          classical visual arts, advertising, design, videoinstallations,
                                                exhibition systems. The specific programme of the course
                                                     is almost completed and will be posted shortly.  For <span class="red">Expoincittà</span>,
                                                         on 29th Oct 2015  Synapticart has realized the workshop “<span class="white">Neurons and superdesign</span>”
                                                              at Superstudiopiù in Milan.
                                                                   At <span class="red">Triennale di Milano</span> on 27th May 2016 Synapticart presented
