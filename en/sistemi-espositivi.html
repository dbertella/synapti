        The laboratory’s purpose is to design and realise
          multi-sensorial exhibition systems for art works
             and top-rank commercial products.
                 The conceptual platform of such cutting-edge systems
                    comes from a biopsychic code, which avails itself
                       of two innovative tools:


                <strong>A )</strong> The use of a new language defined "sub-symbolic",
                 which enables the art work to self-present the genesis
                    of its own anatomic inner composition and of the intrinsic meanings
                      emerging from its physical, perceptive and functional aspects.
                        This way its spacial configuration turns into a perfect narrative sequence.
                            A story is created, then.


                <strong>B )</strong> The use of “exhibition bubbles”, which wrap the  work and the observer
                 ( more precisely small groups of observers) with a flow of multisensorial information,
                     which get assembled according to the principle of " a parallel and distributed representation"
                         of the neural networks  ( see Colecchia, "The Attractive Power of Art Works", Amazon).
                            This expressive system is able to get into resonance with the observer's body
                                before expanding itself into his rational thought,
                                    which is therefore unconsciously influenced by it .
                                         But all this is neither a subliminal effect, nor Freudian unconscious impulse,
                                             rather it is energetic resonance studied by Physics  and with the connective patterns
                                                 studied by Neuroscience.
                                                     This discovery  is really innovative to the current  operators of the exhibition sector.
